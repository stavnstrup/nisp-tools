     <p>This version contains the NISP Volumes 1 - 3 in both html and pdf formats. </p>

     <p>This document, ADatP-34(I), is developed by the Interoperability
     Profiles Capability Team (IP CaT) under the authority of the NATO
     Consultation, Command and Control Board (C3B). It was noted
     by the C3 Board (AC/322-N(2016)xxxx) making the Volume 2 standards and
     volume 3 profiles mandatory for use in NATO common funded
     systems, and made available to the general public as a
     replacement for ADatP-34(H).</p>
