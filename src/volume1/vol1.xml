<sect1 id="v1-Purpose">
<title>Purpose of the NISP</title>
<para>NISP gives guidelines to capability planners, programme managers and test managers for NATO common funded systems in the short or mid-term timeframes.</para>
<para>The NISP prescribes the necessary technical standards and profiles to achieve interoperability of Communications and Information Systems in support of NATO's missions and operations. In accordance with the Alliance C3 Strategy (ref. C-M(2018)0037) all NATO Enterprise (ref. C-M(2014)0061) entities shall adhere to the NISP mandatory standards and profiles in volume 2.</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="v1-Audience">
<title>Intended Audience</title>
<para>The intended audience of the NISP are all stakeholders in the NATO Enterprise, and Allied and Partner nations involved in development, implementation, lifecycle management, and transformation to a federated environment.</para>
<para>There are specific viewpoints that are mapped to the NISP structure. NISP gives guidelines to:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>capability planners involved in NDPP and NATO led initiatives</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>programme managers for building NATO common funded systems</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>test managers for their respective test events (such as CWIX, CIAV, etc.)</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>national planning and programme managers for their national initiatives</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>Specific NATO or national views to the NISP based on data export to external planning and management systems will be possible upon delivery of an updated version of the NISP Exchange Specification.</para>
</sect1>
</chapter>


<chapter id="v1c-concepts">
<title>Basic Concepts</title>
<para>This chapter gives an overview to understand the data in volume 2 and volume 3. NISP does not differentiate between the usage of NATO and non- NATO standards but always strives to select the most appropriate and up to date. The classification (Mandatory or Candidate) of any standard depends on its location in the NISP, Volume 2 or Volume 3, respectively.</para>
<sect1 id="v1c-standards">
<title>Standards</title>
<!-- Define the term Standard-->
<para>The NISP is composed of non-NATO and NATO Standards. While the first ones are adopted by NATO through the NISP. The second ones are to be considered as normative references.</para>
<para>Standards (NATO and non-NATO) are defined and managed in their life cycle by the developing standardization bodies with their own timetable. 
NATO standards are identified in the NISP by their covering document (STANAG number). They can be in the life cycle status of study/in ratification  (no yet NATO approved/expected), promulgated (valid) and superseded/obsolete. 
A non-NATO standard may have different life cycle status such as emerging, mature, fading, or obsolete. Different standardization bodies may use their own lifecycle status definitions. NISP takes lifecyle status of standards into account, but does not copy them into the NISP database. 
To inquire about the current status of NATO standards, please visit the NATO Standardization Document Database (NSDD) hosted on the NATO Standardization Organization (NSO) Website. Superseded/obsolete NATO and non-NATO standards may be included in the NISP for maintenance purpose.</para>
<para>NISP allow references to either a NATO Standard or the covering document if it exists. However, it is recommended that NATO organizations and nations reference a NATO Standard and NOT the covering document for inclusion in the NISP. IP CaT will subsequently add the covering document as well, but only for reference purposes.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="v1c-profiles">
<title>Interoperability Profiles</title>

<para>Profiles define the specific use of standards at a service interoperability point (SIOP) in a given context. 
A SIOP is a reference point within an architecture where one or more service interfaces are physically or logically instantiated to allow systems delivering the same service using different protocols to interoperate.
A SIOP serves as the focal point for service interoperability between interconnected systems, and may be logically located at any level within the components, and its detailed technical specification is contained within a service interface profile (SIP).
Profiles support prerequisites for programmes or projects and enable interoperability implementation and testing.</para>

<para>Interoperability Profiles provide combinations of standards and (sub)profiles for different CIS and identify essential profile elements including:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Capability Requirements and other NAF architectural views</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Characteristic protocols</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Implementation options</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Technical standards</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Service Interoperability Points, and</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The relationship with other profiles such as the system profile to which an application belongs.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
</para>


<para>The NISP now defines the <emphasis role="bold">obligation status</emphasis> of profiles and standards as "mandatory" or "candidate".
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Mandatory</emphasis>: The application of standards or profiles is enforced for NATO common funded systems in planning, implementing and testing. Nations are required to use the NISP for developing capabilities that support NATO's missions (ie. NATO led operations, projects, programs, contracts and other related tasks). Nations are invited to do the same nationally to promote interoperabilty for federated systems and services. </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Candidate</emphasis>:
The application of a standard or profile shall only be used for the purpose of testing and programme / project planning. The standard or profile must have progressed to a stage in its life-cycle and is sufficiently mature and is expected to be approved by the standardization body in the foreseeable future. This implies, that from a planning perspective, the respective standard or profile is expected to become mandatory during execution of the programme. A candidate standard or profile should not stay in volume 3 for more than 3 years.
</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>Profiles shall be updated if referenced standards change. Profiles are dynamic entities by nature. NATO captures this dynamic situation by updating profiles once a year in the NISP. Profile owners are responsible for the versioning of their profiles. Profile reviews are required every 2 years by their owners to ensure their accuracy and continued relevance.</para>
<para>Proposed profiles (and standards) can be accepted as candidates in order to follow their developments and to decide if they can be promoted to mandatory standards and profiles. In some cases proposed standards and profiles can be readily accepted directly as mandatory.</para>
<para>Interoperability Profiles can reference other Interoperability Profiles to allow for maximal reuse.</para>
<para>Further information and guidance on creation of profiles is available in <xref linkend="v1-profileguidance"/>.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
  <title>Basic Standards Profile</title>
<para>Within the NISP, the “<emphasis>Basic Standards Profile</emphasis>” specifies the technical, operational, and business standards that are generally applicable in the context of the Alliance and the NATO Enterprise. For a specific context, such as Federated Mission Networking, separate profiles may be defined that apply specifically to that context or related architectures. The standards that are cited may be NATO standards, or other agreed international and open standards.</para>

<para>As there is no overarching alliance architecture, each standard is associated with elements of the C3 Taxonomy. A distinction must be made between applicability of a standard, and conformance to the standard. If a standard is applicable to a given C3 Taxonomy element, any architecture that implements such an element need not be fully conformant with the standard. The degree of conformance may be judged based on the specific context of the project. For example, to facilitate information exchange between C2 and logistics systems it may be sufficient to implement only a subset of concepts as defined in JC3IEDM (STANAG 5525).</para>

<para>The “Basic Standards Profile” contains “agreed” as well as “candidate” standards.</para>

    <para>The NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) is the primary means to identify the required capabilities and promote their timely and coherent development and acquisition by Allies and Partners. It is operationally driven and delivers various products which could support the development and evolution of more detailed C3 architecture and interoperability requirements. The development of NDPP products also benefits from input by the architecture and interoperability communities, especially the NISP, leading to a more coherent development of CIS capabilities for the Alliance.</para>
<para>The work on Enterprise, Capability, and programme level architecture will benefit from the NISP by selecting coherent sets of standards for profiles. </para>

  <title>Criteria for listing Standards and Profiles</title>

<para>Standards and profiles listed in Volume 2 of the NISP shall:

<orderedlist>
  <listitem><para>have an assigned responsible party that can provide relevant subject matter expertise, if no responsible party exists the IP CaT will create a temporary assignment,</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>be available in one of the NATO official languages,</para></listitem>

<para>Deviations from the rules listed above can be recommended by the IP CaT and approved by the C3B.</para>


<para>Given the rate of innovation in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), it is unsurprising that, NATO standards must be reviewed and updated regularly to keep pace with the state of the art and other international standards. The following criteria should be considered by responsible parties during their annual review of NATO Standards:</para>

These reference tools help clarify the expected behavior described by the standard. If these tools are released under appropriate licenses, the tools themselves or components thereof can be directly integrated into vendor products, reducing the investment cost, and therefore the risk, of adoption and accelerating adoption efforts. For standards that rely on multiple parties, such as communications protocols between two different roles, having a reference implementation for both communicants can be a big help to implementers by giving them a correspondent against which to test their own implementation. As such, simple implementation efforts can have a significant role in encouraging interoperability and adoption.</para></footnote> of the Standard available to vendors?</para></listitem>

<title>National Systems Interoperability Coordination</title>
      <para>Coordination of standards and profiles between Nations and NATO are critical for interoperability.
        As a result of the C3 Board substructure reorganization,  participants in IP CaT are subject matter experts (SME) and are no longer national representatives.
        SME's should therefore coordinate with national and C3 Board representatives to ensure national perspectives are presented to IP CaT. As such, each of the
        IP CaT SMEs is responsible for:</para>

<para>National level coordination of interoperability technical standards and profiles is the responsibility of the C3 Board.
When the latest version of NISP is approved by the C3 Board, it will become the NATO Standard covered by STANAG 5524.
This STANAG contains the agreement of the participating nations regarding usage of the mandatory standards and profiles in the NISP.

    <para>The NISP references Standards from different standardization bodies<footnote><para>In case of conflict between any adopted non-NATO standard and relevant NATO standard, the definition of
the latter prevails.</para></footnote>. In the case of a ratified STANAG, NATO standardization procedures apply. The NISP only references these STANAG’s without displaying the country-specific reservations. The country-specific reservations can be found in the NATO Standardization Office's NATO  Standardization Document Database.</para>

    <para>The Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) nations will use NISP Volume 2 to publish the interoperability standards for the CCEB under the provisions of the NATO-CCEB List of Understandings (LoU)<footnote><para>References: NATO Letter AC/322(SC/5)L/144 of 18 October 2000, CCEB Letter D/CCEB/WS/1/16 of 9 November 2000, NATO Letter AC/322(SC/5)L/157 of 13 February 2001</para></footnote>.</para>

    <para>The NISP organizes the standards using the structure of baseline 5.0 of NATO's C3 Taxonomy, as endorsed by the NATO C3 Board per AC/322-D(2021)0021 on “C3 Taxonomy Baseline 5.0” dated 23 September 2021. A graphical representation of this taxonomy is given in the following figure and a description of it can be obtained at: <ulink url="https://tide.act.nato.int/tidepedia/index.php/C3_Taxonomy">https://tide.act.nato.int/mediawiki/tidepedia/index.php/C3_Taxonomy_Baseline_5</ulink>. Currently, the standards only address a subset of the services in the taxonomy, mainly services in the group Technical Services. For some standards it is indicated that an appropriate mapping to the C3 Taxonomy could not yet be made.

    <title>Applicability</title>
    <para>The mandatory standards and profiles documented in Volume 2 will be used in the implementation of NATO Common Funded Systems. Participating nations agree to use the mandatory standards and profiles included in the NISP at the Service Interoperability Points and to use Service Interface Profiles among NATO and Nations to support the exchange of information and the use of information services in the NATO realm.</para>
