   <title>ArchiMate Exchange Format</title>

   <para>The C3B have tasked IP CaT to improve the consistency and usability of NISP. IP CaT have therefore in "A standard representation and
exchange specification for Interoperability Standards and Profiles" ver 0.8 dated Dec 10, 2020 (AC-322-WP(2020)0036) specified a semantic representation of the data set contained in the NISP
as an architecture model in the Open Group ArchiMate Modelling Language so that
this model can be exchanged via the ArchiMate Model Exchange File Format Standard between
tools and/or systems that can import, and export ArchiMate models. ArchiMate Exchange Files
enable exporting content from one ArchiMate modelling tool or repository and importing it into
another while retaining information describing the model in the file and how it is structured,
such as a list of model elements and relationships. Extensions of ArchiMate are specified in
accordance with the Language Customization Mechanisms and where possible re-use metadata
elements defined by the NATO Core Metadata Specification (NCMS)to limit the
definition of NISP specific metadata requirements.</para>
