  <title>International Military Interoperability for information exchange in
  the NNEC context</title>

  <simpara><emphasis role="bold">Summary</emphasis></simpara>

  <para>This design rule describes how military organisations can develop and
  implement the ability to exchange information and services with military
  organizations from other nations to become interoperable. It touches on, but
  does not fully address the problems related to organizational structures and
  behaviour when multiple organisations collaborate in a federative manor in a
  mission.</para>

      <para>This design rule targets any military organization that plan or
      foresee that it will participate in a mission where exchange of
      information and services with other military organizations is
      vital.</para>

      <para>Within these organizations, the intended users are requirement
      analysts, architects and high-level designers of NNEC compliant
      systems.</para>

      <para>This document defines patterns for enabling information exchange

    <title>Design Rule</title>

    <para>This design rule is developed for use in NATO Interoperability
    Standards &amp; Profiles (NISP) version 4. It is based on experiences from
    the Swedish Network Based Defence initiative where it extends the design
    rule for Interoperability <xref linkend="dr-mil-ref-drinteroperability" />
    and the IEAT concept developed within the frame of Multinational
    Experiment 5<xref linkend="dr-mil-ref-ieat" />. The design rule also
    considers the NATO Information Exchange Gateway (IEG) concept<xref
    linkend="dr-mil-gwimpl" />.</para>

    <para>The design rule is applicable for collaborative federations in the
    coming 2-6 years which means that it covers both existing systems which
    won&rsquor;t be replaced as well as new systems which are developed and
    implemented during this time period.</para>

    <para>The technical scope for the design rule is the highlighted areas of
    <xref linkend="v6f-simpleNNECframework" />. The design rule does not
    describe how to achieve interoperability on the Transport/Network level.
    Furthermore, it does not cover interoperability on the Community of
    Interest level. However, when design rules for these levels are created,
    this design rule will be used as the basis for enabling information
    exchange via services.</para>

      <title>Context</title>

      <sect3>
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>The design rule should be used when there is a need for several
        different military actors to cooperate in a federative manor in order
        to solve a common mission. The key capabilities that this design rule
        will help enable are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Collaborative planning between multiple actors in a
            federation</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Collaborative synchronization of execution between multiple
            actors in a federation</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Collaborative assessment between multiple actors in a
            federation</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The design rule does not address the operational activities
        needed to achieve the above capabilities, nor does it address the
        Community Of Interest (COI) technical services which supports these
        activities. Instead the design rule describes a set of principles,
        technologies and activities needed to create a technical platform
        which enables information exchange between the actors and can act as a
        foundation for the COI specific technical services when these are to
        be developed and deployed.</para>

        <para>Since the design rule captures knowledge from previous
        experiences in this area it can save time and money for the involved
        actors. If the design rule is applied when defining the profile for
        such a mission, less time will be spent on getting to agreement on
        which services and underpinning technologies shall be used in the
        mission.</para>

        <para>Many of the activities and technologies described in this design
        rule can also be applied when exchanging information and services with
        other actors than military organizations. However, there are specific
        aspects of collaborating with this type of organizations which are not
        covered by this design rule.</para>

        <para>A suitable definition of interoperability in this design rule
        context (i.e. technical context) is: The ability of technical systems
        and/or organizations using technical systems to operate together by
        making (necessary) data &amp; information and/or services produced by
        one system or organization available to the others, in an agreed
        format.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="v6s-intmilfed">
        <title>The International Military Federation</title>

        <para>There are many challenges that have to be overcome in order to
        make collaborative work and knowledge sharing among the actors in an
        operation successful. In <xref linkend="v6s-solution" /> of this
        design rule mainly addresses the technical aspects of the
        establishment of federation in which collaborating actors can exchange
        information. However, organizational, process and legislation aspects
        must be covered to some extent since all of these needs to be
        harmonized in order to make the collaboration effective. Therefore, a
        number of non-technical issues are described in <xref
        linkend="v6s-problem" />.</para>

        <para>The federation, depicted in <xref linkend="v6f-fedoverview" />,
        is where the collaborating actors provide services which the other
        actors can consume. To create a federation, the actors need to create
        a federation agreement which defines the rules of the federation, such
        as which data formats, information classifications should be used.
        Rules regarding information ownership and service levels (including
        quality of service) are also included in the federation
        agreement.</para>

        <para>Collaboration in multilateral operations has previously been
        based on bi-lateral agreements between all participants, but in order
        to achieve the speed and flexibility needed today, there is a need to
        establish a baseline federation agreement which can be used as a
        starting point when creating new missions.</para>

        <para>Actors which participate in the federation connect networks and
        systems within their responsibility (i.e. domain) to other actors in
        order to be able to exchange information. To protect the internal
        information and control which information is being exchanged one or
        more Information Exchange Gateways (IEG) are stood up between the
        federation and the actors&rsquor; network. In the IEG, one or more
        service interfaces are physically instantiated. This is referred to as
        a Service Interoperability Point (SIOP) according to the NATO C3
        System Architecture Framework <xref
        linkend="dr-mil-ref-nc3saf" />.</para>

        <para>Within an actor&rsquor;s domain there can be one or more
        networks where information is stored. The decision which internal
        networks shall be connected is taken by each actor (Federation member)
        independently of the other actors. In <xref
        linkend="v6f-fedoverview" /> two example networks are depicted, one
        federation network which holds information only relevant to the
        federation and one which is the actors&rsquor; internal network. In
        this case, the IEG handles information exchange between these two
        networks as well as information exchange with other actors
        IEGs.</para>

        <para>The remainder of the design rule describes the challenges the
        actors face and how they can cooperate in order to create a federation
        to exchange information in a secure manor.</para>

        <title>Related design rule areas</title>

        <para>Interoperability is closely linked to the following other design
        rule areas:</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Flexibility</emphasis>: The requirements
        on interoperability will change over time. Also, in some situations,
        very limited time will be available for making the necessary
        modifications of the system in order to fulfil the new requirements.
        This means that the organization, security and technical systems need
        to be very flexible with respect to configuration and modifiability in
        order to be able to adapt to changing and extended interoperability
        requirements. For more information, refer to <xref
        linkend="dr-mil-ref-flex" />.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Information security</emphasis>: With
        interoperability follows information security risks that must be
        handled. The connection of external systems must be done in such a way
        that the information security of each nation or organisation is not
        compromised. However information security mechanisms cannot be allowed

          <title>Architecture description framework</title>

          <para>In order for all parties to obtain a common
          &ldquo;language&rdquor; on how to describe their systems and the
          services they bring to the federation this design rule also covers
          an architecture description framework. The architecture description
          framework does not describe the architecture itself, but rather
          guides how the architecture shall be structured and what it should
          describe.</para>

          <para>The current valid description framework within NATO is the
          NATO Architectural Framework (NAF) version 3<xref
          linkend="dr-mil-ref-naf3" /> which provide the rules, guidance, and
          product descriptions for developing, presenting and communicating
          architectures which includes both operational aspects as well as
          technical aspects <xref linkend="principle4" />.</para>

          <para>In the Framework, there are seven major perspectives (i.e.,
          views) that logically combine to describe the architecture of an
          enterprise. These are the NATO All View (NAV), NATO Capability View
          (NCV), NATO Programme View (NPV), NATO Operational View (NOV), NATO
          Systems View (NSV), NATO Service-Oriented View (NSOV) and NATO
          Technical View (NTV). Each of the seven views depicts certain
          architecture attributes. Some attributes bridge several views and
          provide integrity, coherence, and consistency to architecture
          descriptions.</para>

          <para>To support the creation of views and make sure they are
          consistent, NAF v3 defines a metamodel. The NATO Architecture
          Framework Metamodel (NMM) defines the relationships between the
          different components of the framework. It defines the architectural
          objects and components that are permitted in NAF v3 views and their
          relationships with each other.</para>

          <para>There are certain views which are more important when
          designing architectures for multinational operations where
          interoperability is in focus <xref linkend="issue10" />:</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">NATO All-Views (NAV)</emphasis> which
          capture aspects which overarch all other views. These views set the
          scope and context of the architecture, such as goals and vision,
          scenario and environmental conditions as well as time.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">NATO Capability View (NCV)</emphasis>
          which explain what capabilities are needed in order to fulfil the
          strategic intent for the mission. Specifically, capabilities related
          to interaction between actors are important to identify in these
          views. If produced correctly, these views can already say a lot of
          which services are needed to fulfil the business needs. In
          particular, the NCV-2, Capability Taxonomy and NCV-7, Capability to
          Services Mapping views are important.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">NATO Operational View (NOV)</emphasis>
          which is a description of the tasks and activities, operational
          elements, and information exchanges required to accomplish NATO
          missions. To design for interoperability all of these views do not
          have to be complete, but it is important to know which operational
          nodes exist and how they interact (NOV-2). Also, the information
          model defined in the NOV-7 view is important, especially for such
          information for which there are no or unclear standards to rely on.
          When going into more details of the architecture, the requirements
          on information exchange (NOV-3) are necessary to understand.</para>

          <para>Currently, the operational views in NAF does not fully support
          modelling of services. The authors of this design rule recommends
          that future versions of NAF are complemented with the capabilities
          of using services to describe interaction between operational nodes
          instead of needlines.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">NATO Service-Oriented View
          (NSOV)</emphasis> focuses strictly on identifying and describing
          services. The view also supports the description of service
          taxonomies, service orchestrations and a mapping of services to
          operational activities. The service description (NSOV-2) is a key
          component of a Service Oriented Architecture <xref
          linkend="principle6" />. It is used to detach the functionality
          provided by a system (or services provided by an organizational
          unit) from the actual system. A service description includes
          information on how to interact with the service, what requirements a

          <para>An Information Exchange Model (IEM) is a specification of the
          information which are exchanged between operational nodes. IEMs are
          used when deciding which information objects are to be exchanged in
          service interactions. The specification is done according to the
          NOV-7 view of NAF<xref linkend="dr-mil-ref-naf3" />.</para>

          <para>Given the timeframe for this design rule, a model based

          <title>Information Exchange Objects</title>

          complexity from the simplest form with a number of data elements and
          an identifier to complex data structures and large quantities of
          data elements. Examples of information objects are documents,
          messages and data sets such as geographical data sets.</para>

          <para>Information objects are created, processed, stored and
          moved/exchanged via services. An information exchange object is a
          standardised view, or an excerpt from, an information exchange model
          which from a technical point of view is suitable to exchange as a
          coherent set. Thus information exchange objects is a subset of all
          information objects which are meant to be exchanged via
          services.</para>

          information. I.e. how are services and information specified in

          architecture.</para>

          <para>As depicted in <xref linkend="v6f-servinfasp" />, a service
          has operations. They are used for specification of how a consumer
          can interact with the service, for example create, read, update,
          delete. An operation requires one or more information objects to be
          exchanged between the consumer and provider, for example a message
          or a document. These exchange objects are excerpts from an
          information exchange model.</para>

        <title>The security aspect</title>

        <para>When determining appropriate security solutions for a federation
        it is of outmost importance to analyse the information which needs to
        be assured. This is important in order to avoid a &ldquo;too
        secure&rdquor; solution, thus introducing higher costs and more
        difficult procedures than needed. The flexibility which is introduced
        by the NNEC concept requires a constant analysis of the need for
        information confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA). Also,
        time needs to be considered in these analyses, i.e. how long does the
        information need to be protected.</para>

        <para>This design rule does not cover how to perform CIA analyses, but
        it is certain that there is a need to be able to handle different
        levels of security in the federation. A set of scenarios has been
        defined in the IEG concept<xref linkend="dr-mil-gwimpl" /> which are
        used in this design rule to handle difference in security
        levels.</para>

        <simpara><emphasis role="bold">The Information Exchange Gateway
        Concept</emphasis></simpara>

        <para>Information Exchange Gateways (IEGs) are used to protect
        information assets of the participants in the federation. Since each
        participant provides an IEG to protect their assets there is a need to
        standardise the services and the architecture of IEGs in order to
        enable sharing of IEG components between the participants and use of
        commercially available technology. The NATO IEG concept<xref
        linkend="dr-mil-gwimpl" /> describes that each IEG has three major
        services:</para>

        <para>&ldquo;The first is the Node Protection Service (NPS). The NPS
        provides protection to the infrastructure; its purpose is to protect
        the physical assets of the &ldquo;node&rdquor; or nation being
        protected by the IEG.&rdquor;</para>

        <para>&ldquo;The second major component/service is the Information
        Protection Service (IPS). NATO and each nation are responsible for
        protecting the flow of information out of its area (node or network).
        The mechanisms used to protect the information flow must satisfy the
        organization (nation or NATO) that the IEG is
        protecting.&rdquor;</para>

        <para>&ldquo;The third major component/service is the Information
        Exchange Service (IES). The IEG must facilitate the flow of
        information between the protected node/network and the external
        organizations that are authorized (by the Information Protection
        Service).&rdquor;</para>

        <para>Together these services provide the solution to issues <xref

        <para>Information Zones is a concept identified and defined <!--

        surrounding with a number of services and nodes inside the zone. The
        concept gives the advantage to separate assurance on security
        mechanisms to meet external and internal threats.</para>

        <para>In a federative approach such as the one described in this
        design rule, each federation participant (actor) is to be considered
        as (at least) one information zone. The reason for this is that there
        is a clear responsibility for information and information management
        within each actor. At the border of the information zones there are
        Information Exchange Gateways (IEG) which protects the information
        within the zone and allows controlled sharing of information between
        information zones. See <xref linkend="v6f-fedinfozones" />.</para>

        <para>The information classification level in each zone will differ
        and therefore the information assurance level needs to be adjusted
        accordingly. I.e. the more sensitive information within a zone, the
        more protection and dissemination control is needed.</para>

        <para>By basing the security on information zones with boundary
        protection and controlled information flow and access to the zone, it
        is made easier to achieve high assurance since only a few mechanisms,
        i.e. the IEG, needs to be inspected/evaluated to meet the security
        requirement.</para>

        <para>In the federation there may be several information zones
        depending on the classification of exchanged information. However, the
        number of information zones should be kept to a minimum in order to
        avoid unnecessary costs and complexity for implementation and
        maintenance of the federation.</para>

        federation.</para>

        <para>There are two basic user requirements defined in <xref

        defined in this chapter. These requirements are:</para>

            <listitem>

        <para>To be able to fulfil these requirements, a set of technical
        capabilities are needed. First of all, there must be network (IP)
        connectivity between the actors in the federation; however this is not
        covered by this design rule. Once network connectivity is established,
        the technical systems of the actors need to be able to publish and
        find the services which are to be used. Of course, all communication
        in the federation network must be secured by relevant security
        mechanisms.</para>

        <para>In order to fulfil <xref linkend="ier1" />, users first need to

        <para>To fulfil <xref linkend="ier2" /> the Information Discovery
        Services are used to find relevant information. To retrieve the

        then the Translation Services are used to translate the

        <para>Lastly, it is important for the actors in the federation to know
        the status of the services in the federation, especially if there are

          <para>The Service registry enables the technical systems to discover

          <para>Each actor in a federation holds information which might be
          relevant to other actors. Therefore it is of outmost importance that
          there are mechanisms to discover information across actors. These
          mechanisms have to include the capability for an actor to decide
          which information shall be available to others according to <xref
          linkend="principle1" /> and <xref linkend="principle2" />.</para>

          <para>There are mainly two ways of making the information discovery
          happen. One is to copy information between actors and let each actor
          make the information searchable, but this is not very efficient
          since it requires a lot of bandwidth and makes it hard to keep track
          of which information has been copied.</para>

          <para>The other way of enabling information discovery is to use a
          federated search pattern where each actor provides a search
          interface to its information. This is much more efficient from a
          data distribution point of view, but requires that all actors come
          to agreement on the search interface. There are initiatives ongoing
          to standardise the ability to perform federated search, the most
          prominent one is the OpenSearch initiative<footnote>
              <para>http://www.opensearch.org/</para>
            </footnote>. Even though OpenSearch is not a formal standard it is
          well on its way to be adopted by many of the major tool
          vendors.</para>

          <para>In either case, the actors in the federation must implement
          search engines which can index information (if the have any) and
          search clients which can access the search engines. A search client
          is in most cases an ordinary web browser, but can also be a more
          complex application if there are specific needs.</para>

          <simpara><emphasis role="bold">Metadata Registry
          Services</emphasis></simpara>

          <para>A metadata registry is a database which contains information
          about information which is useful for enabling information
          discovery. For example, search engines create metadata registries
          when they index content. But there are also other applications for
          metadata registries, like when an actor has sensitive information
          which needs to be able to be discovered. Say that there is a
          database which contains classified analyses of some sort. The
          analyses are of very good quality and can be of use to many, but it
          is impossible to publish them to everyone in the federation. So in
          order to make other actors aware that the analysis exists,
          unclassified analysis metadata, like what the analysis looks at and
          who has done it, can be published in a metadata repository. Now the
          other actors can discover that there is an analysis and contact the
          author to get approval for getting the contents.</para>

          <para>To be able to store the metadata, the NATO Discovery Metadata
          Specification (NDMS) SHALL be used. This specification is based on
          the international standard ISO 15836 the Dublin Core (DC) Metadata
          Element Set.</para>

          <para>Sharing information about users is key to a federation since
          it enables people to find each other. The user directory holds
          information which enables authentication of users by certificates
          and public keys, authorization of users by roles and discovery of
          users by contact information which enables collaboration.</para>

          <para>Each actor in the network shall provide information about the
          users that represents them. However, it is preferable if the
          federation has one point of access to all user directories.
          Therefore, the implementation of user directories in a federation
          shall follow the federated database pattern. This means that each
          actor provides their own database, but one actor provides a single
          entry point to all databases.</para>

          <para>For the user registry LDAP shall be used according to
          NISP<xref linkend="dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" />. Products which can

          service</emphasis></simpara>

          <para>E-mail has become one of the most important applications for
          any business or organization of today. The main challenge for using
          e-mail in a federation is to be able to control that no classified
          information is embedded or attached to e-mails going out from an
          actor and protecting the actors from malicious software, such as
          viruses. This means that the IEG needs to be able to scan and filter
          incoming and outgoing messages.</para>

          <para>Extra care needs to be taken for outgoing information where
          confidential information can be hidden in document history and
          inside images. Therefore, only text-based attachments (like
          OpenDocument Format or Office Open XML, see NISP<xref
          linkend="dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" />) without inserted code or images
          shall be allowed through the IEG.</para>

          <para>It is also vital to have a manual inspection capability in the
          IEG to be able to assess the degree of confidentiality of the e-mail
          messages leaving an actor.</para>

          <para>As described by NISP<xref linkend="dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" />,
          SMTP according to RFC 2821 and others SHALL be used for e-mail. To
          secure communication between SMTP agents, TLS according to RFC 3207,
          SHOULD be used.</para>

          <simpara><emphasis role="bold">Instant messaging
          service</emphasis></simpara>

          <para>For instant messaging XMPP (IETF RFC3920:2004 -3923:2004)
          SHALL be used according to NISP<xref
          linkend="dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" />. XMPP is an XML based
          publish/subscribe protocol which is used by most of the dominant
          tool vendors. Using XML enables possibility for inspection and
          control of messages in IEGs which is very important in a
          federation.</para>

          <para>There is one important aspect of XMPP which is not covered by
          the current standard specification; there is no security tagging
          options available which is needed when messages shall be passed
          between information zones with different security classifications.
          So if this is required a custom extension to XMPP needs to be
          defined.</para>

          <para>Another thing which must be considered in a federation is
          routing of messages. Currently there are no XMPP servers which
          support routing of XMPP messages. This consequence of not being able
          to route messages is that the IEG has to be implemented as a
          transparent proxy, i.e. the systems on the outside of the IEG need
          to know about the systems on the inside. Even though the IEG can be
          used for inspection and filtering of messages in this case; it is
          not always a preferred solution from a security perspective. So, if
          the security requirements say that the IEG needs to act as a
          non-transparent proxy, the XMPP server needs to be modified to be
          able to act as an XMPP server and be able to route messages between
          XMPP domains.</para>

          <para>In order to achieve an efficient exchange of information
          between the actors in a federation there is a need to be able to
          route and distribute messages. This type of capability is often
          included in the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) concept.</para>

          <para>An ESB refers to a software architecture construct,
          implemented by technologies found in a category of middleware
          infrastructure products usually based on Web services standards that
          provides foundational services for more complex service-oriented
          architectures.</para>

          <para>An ESB generally provides an abstraction layer on top of an
          implementation of an Enterprise Messaging System which allows
          integration architects to exploit the value of messaging without

          <para>The ESB shall enable endpoints to interact in their native

              model, so a request/response interaction is handled by two
              related one-way message flows -- one for the request and one for
              the response.</para>

          <para>When implementing the ESB concept in federations there are
          some things which must be considered. First, the products which
          realize the messaging and mediation capabilities needs to be the
          same everywhere since there are very small chances of realizing
          integration between two different products due to a lack of
          standardization. This means that the federation agreement must
          include which product to use.</para>

          <para>Secondly, the management of rules for transformation of
          messages needs to be considered. ESB and messaging products are
          often built for central management of transformation rules, thus
          enabling a better control over the messaging capabilities in an
          enterprise. However, this can be problematic in a federative
          approach since all actors need to agree on the transformation rules
          or appoint one actor which has the authority to manage these.</para>

          <title>Service Management Services</title>

          <para>Service management can be divided into managing, where the
          technical systems and services are being controlled, and monitoring
          where information regarding the status of the technical systems and
          services are shared.</para>

          <para>In a federation, the participants may be able to managed
          systems and services provided by other participants, but this is
          unlikely due to information responsibility of organizations. I.e. a
          participant which is responsible for the information within its
          information zone will not let another actor have administrative
          privileges to the system where this information resides.</para>

          <para>However, sharing monitoring information between the
          participants is essential if the Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
          shall be fulfilled. These SLAs are included in the agreements for
          information exchange as specified by <xref
          linkend="principle3" />.</para>

          <para>Monitoring information is to be provided using the Simple
          Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMP v3) standard according
          to NISP<xref linkend="dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" />. Using a non-XML
          based format for monitoring, like SNMP, will require a special
          filtering engine in the IEG IPS (see chapter <xref
          linkend="v6s-infassserv" />).</para>

          <para>It is important to set the monitoring scope properly when
          implementing the monitoring solution in order to avoid dissemination
          of to much information into the federation. Therefore, monitoring
          information SHALL only be provided regarding the services which are

    <title>Motivation</title>

    <para>The NATO Network Enabled Capability (NNEC) Feasibility
    Study<footnote>
        <para>EAPC(AC/322)N(2005)0007</para>
      </footnote> highlights that &ldquo;at their meeting in November 2002,
    the NATO C3 Board (NC3B) agreed that there was a need to develop a NATO
    concept to adapt national initiatives such as the U.S. Network Centric
    Warfare (NCW) and the U.K. Network Enabled Capability (NEC) to the NATO
    context. This NATO concept is referred to as (NNEC) &hellip;. The NNEC
    must provide for the timely exchange of secure information, utilising
    communication networks which are seamlessly interconnected, interoperable
    and robust, and which will support the timely collection, fusion, analysis
    and sharing of information&rdquor;.</para>

    <para>One of the key milestones along the route towards realising the NNEC
    strategy has been set out in the NATO Networked Consultation, Command and
    Control Interoperability Policy<footnote>
        <para>AC/322-D(2008)0041 (INV) dated 30 October 20008</para>
      </footnote> refers.</para>

    <para>In particular, the policy states that &ldquo;It is the intent of
    NATO that measures shall be put into effect by the Organisation and by
    individual nations to ensure that information sharing requirements are met
    securely and expeditiously. This intent requires that appropriate
    interoperability solutions and procedures to match IOR over time shall be
    identified/developed with the nations and documented by the
    NC3B.&rdquor;</para>

    <para>This design rule satisfies the above requirement of the NATO
    Networked C3 Interoperability Policy by identifying the high level design
    rules required for exchange of information services.</para>

    <para>Information services are the primary mechanism for information
    interchange in a NATO environment. This is highlighted in the NATO
    Networked C3 interoperability policy: &ldquo;This policy identifies
    NATO&rsquor;s intent for NNC3 interoperability, and identifies the
    principles and responsibilities for ensuring the development and effective
    use of systems to provide interoperable services supporting the sharing of
    information across the physical, information and human
    domains&rdquor;.</para>

    <title>Consequences from the solutions</title>

    <para>SOA offers a mechanism for achieving the agility required for NNEC.
    Whereas the current stove-piped way of doing business is rigid and
    difficult to adapt because business functions and the supporting IT are so
    tightly coupled, an SOA exploits newly available software components and
    web standards that can be reconfigured easily and quickly. SOA translates
    capabilities, processes and functions into services which can be invoked
    by a user through an interface. This requires the services to be available
    and the user to know the &ldquo;what, how, how much and when&rdquor; of
    accessing them. How the services work is of no consequence to the user but
    is important to designers and architects. The underlying principles are
    not new, but the web services and related technology to bring it to life
    are; reinforced by their wide acceptance.</para>

    <para>The predominant precept is that SOA is business driven. This puts
    designated defence Process Owners in the driving seat because they place
    requirements for service provision. If SOA is to be successful it means
    that they must truly understand what drives the capability they are
    entrusted to deliver so that they are in a position to inform/drive how it
    can be delivered to users in the most effective and efficient manner
    possible. New technology enables much looser coupling between business
    processes and the IT systems which support them and so overcome one of the
    key drivers of cost in most IT deployments &ndash; tight coupling i.e.
    changes in one area requiring a cascade of other required changes in order
    to work; with familiar cost, time and performance penalties. To support
    this, a high level governance structure is essential to enforce data and
    quality of service standards which enable reuse of services.</para>

    <para>There are many benefits to SOA. They include access to previously
    unavailable information, the design of reusable services, the ability to
    make up new services from existing ones, the ability for businesses to
    make changes without costly IT expenditure, and so on. Moreover, the
    issues subtending from the use of legacy systems and the requirement to
    leverage as much value for money as possible from their continued use,
    becomes much less difficult by adopting a service perspective. For those
    who embrace SOA and see it through, the prospect of a working NNEC becomes
    realisable for the first time.</para>

    <para>SOA is already here and any new major system provided by any one of
    the leading industry vendors is likely to have an SOA capability embedded
    in it. However, it should be noted that the federated model of SOA
    described in this design rule is still an emerging concept which will take
    time to reach maturity.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Examples</title>

    <para>The diagram below shows the concept of federated SOA using a
    simplified model with participants of Organisation A and Organisation B.
    Organisations are required to build SOA enterprise scale systems that
    conform to the NATO Overarching Architecture. The organisations&rsquor;
    SOA are connected in a federated manner providing maximum scalability and
    interoperability.</para>

    <para>The actual physical connection between the SOAs is at the
    communications layer. The point of interconnection is called the Service
    interoperability point (SIOP). The standards used to connect at the SIOP
    are documented in a Service interoperability profile or SIP.</para>

    <para>There are also logical connections at the Core Services layer and
    COI Services layers. These connections also have associated SIPs.</para>

    <para>An example of the Core Services SIOP is currently being investigated
    and demonstrated by UK MOD.<footnote>
        <para>Federated ESB Interoperabilty Specification - version dated 1
        April 2008.</para>
      </footnote></para>

    <para>There is also a logical connection at the COI Services layer. The
    ability to share COI services is where the main benefit is realised as
    these are the business services used to undertake missions. Using the
    guidelines outlined in this design rule, organisations can interoperate by
    sharing COI services to perform business tasks. For example the UK MOD SOA
    pilot project has demonstrated a &ldquo;logistics demand service&rdquor;
    which follows a business process to fulfil a request for a store item or
    spare part.</para>
