			<para>The Situational Awareness profile is composed of a collection of standard profiles related to the provision of consistent
environmental, temporal and spatial information to decision-makers. Situation Awareness is the perception of environmental
elements with respect to time and/or space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status, affecting
the safe, expedient and effective conduct of the mission. It involves being aware of what is happening in specified operational
domains to understand how information, events, and actions (both own and others) might impact goals and objectives, both
immediately and in the near future.</para>
