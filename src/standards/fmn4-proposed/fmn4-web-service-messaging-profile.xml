			<para>The Web Service Messaging Profile (WSMP) defines a set of service profiles to exchange a wide range of XML-based
messages. WSMP is extensible and may be used by any Community of Interest (COI).</para>
			<para>It is based on publicly available standards and defines a generic message exchange profile based on the
Request/Response (RR) and the Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) Message Exchange Pattern (MEP). WSMP is platform
independent and can be profiled for different wire protocols such as SOAP, REST, JMS, AMQP, and WEBSocket.</para>
			<para>This profile is intended for software developers to implement interoperable "WSMP services" and "WSMP clients".</para>
