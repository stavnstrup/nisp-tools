			<para>The Communities of Interest (COI) Enabling Profile supports the COI-Enabling Services to provide COI-dependant
functionality required by more than one community of interest. They are similar to Business Support Services in that they
provide building blocks for domain-specific service development. The distinction between the two is that Business Support
Services provide generic COI-independent capabilities for the entire enterprise (e.g. collaboration and information
management services) and COI-Enabling Services provide those COI-dependant services that are typically shared by a
group of communities (e.g. operational planning and situational awareness capabilities). A second distinction is that
COI-Enabling Services tend to be specific for NATO's Consultation, Command and Control (C3) processes whereas
Business Support Services tend to be more generic and can be used by any business or enterprise.</para>
