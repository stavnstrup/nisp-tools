			<para>The MIP 4 profile should be used primarily for the exchange of Battlespace Objects; this profile is not
intended to support high volume, high frequency updates such as Friendly Force Tracks (FFT). Nor is
it intended to support the exchange of data over tactical bearers (with limited capacity and
intermittent availability). The MIP interoperability specification comprises both a mandatory technical
interface specification as well as implementation guidance documents, and is available on the MIP
website (https://www.mip-interop.org). The MIP Baseline 4 specification is updated periodically and it
is designed to safeguard inter-version compatibility between increments.</para>
