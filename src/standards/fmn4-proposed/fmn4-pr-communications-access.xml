			<para>The Communications Access Profile enables Communications Access Services to provide end-to-end connectivity.
Communications Access Services can be interfaced directly to Transmission Services (e.g. in the case of personal
communications systems) or to Transport Services, which in turn interact with Transmission Services for the actual physical
transport. Because they are defined end-to-end, in a comms service map, the same Access Service block can be found at
both ends of the link, and will often (but not necessarily) be implemented and managed by the same service provider.</para>
			<para>Communications Access Services correspond to customer-facing communications services. As such, they can also be
referred to as Subscriber Services, or Customer-Edge (CE) Services. In most cases, they involve the direct connection of
hosts or end-user devices that interface the service on a given layer of the communications stack.</para>
