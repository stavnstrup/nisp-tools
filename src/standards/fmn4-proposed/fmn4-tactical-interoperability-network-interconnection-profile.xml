		<description>
			<para>The Tactical Interoperability Network Interconnection Profile provide the technical details to create a shared
interoperability network at the mobile tactical edge. When no common waveform for land tactical radios can be used for
a federation, a standard "bridging" solution based on loaned radios can be used to mitigate the interoperability problem.</para>
			<para>The architectural pattern "asset exchange pattern" to achieve operational interoperability. Such a asset exchange
pattern would aim for "Interchangeability" of assets from different Mission Network (MN) participants. Interchangeability,
is the ability of one product, process or service to be used in place of another to fulfil the same requirements.</para>
			<para>Mobile Tactical Edge information exchange for FMN Spiral 4 is limited to “FMN Spiral 4 Service Instruction for Mobile
Tactical Edge Land C2 Information Exchange”, which is basically data exchange based on STANAG 4677. This data
exchange service relies for Spiral 4 on a shared interoperability network based on the loaned radio concept, described in
this document.</para>
			<para>The information exchanged over the interface between Tactical CIS and the Radio shall be protected with similar
mechanism that required to protect NATO RESTRICTED information or equivalent national classification level. The
protection of information at the lower tactical level has a number of distinctive characteristics:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>information is often transient and perishable – it is only relevant for a short period of time</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>transmission of information is confined to a small geographic area.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>information is held on portable devices which are often close to physical threats</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>networks at the lower tactical are often isolated from the wider network.</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
